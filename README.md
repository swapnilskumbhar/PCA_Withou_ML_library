# PCA_Withou_ML_library
In this repository I have tried to explain one of the most popular dimentionality reduction technique which is knwon as Principal 
Component Analysis and the math used behind it. We will use the same data which we have used while understanding the K_means clustering
basics. For better understanding I have introduced an extra column in the data which is built of the device. There is no data variance in
that column so our algorithm should give minimum priority to that column. 
I hope you will able to basics of the PCA
